Data Analysis Using SQL and Excel

Data:

https://media.wiley.com/product_ancillary/3X/11190214/DOWNLOAD/9781119021438WebsiteFiles.zip
zip of a bunch of spreadsheets, some txt files, and some SQL scripts that parse the txt files and upload them to your SQL server once you get that running. 

Tools:

VSCode--https://code.visualstudio.com/ FOSS code editor. You can actually do the SQL queries from within pgAdmin4, but vscode offers a much easier way to manage the files your queries will be stored in. Much better UI for setting up complicated queries too
PostgreSQL plugin by Chris Kolkman--useful explorer that provides a tab in VSCode where you can see the server/db/schema of your chosen connection

PostgreSQL plugin by Microsoft--has the same name. Stupid that can happen. Useful tho; associates SQL files and queries with connections, allows keyboard shortcuts to run queries. Worth noting: has a massive bug where if you run a query, and close the resulting "result" tab, it won't open a new result tab until you restart.
